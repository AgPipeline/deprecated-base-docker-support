# Transformer Unit Tests
This folder holds the unit tests TravisCI will run in it's build. 
All tests are written in and utilizing pytest. In addition to this, pylint will also be deployed.

### Running the tests
Simply pushing commited tests will trigger a travis build to run the tests automatically and should send an error report with all the places the tests are failing.
